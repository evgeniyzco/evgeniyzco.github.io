This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data protection and details the kinds of information we might collect and process when you download and/or use the Watch Faces software application on mobile devices ("the App"). It also describes how we work with our partners to manage this information. <br /><br />When we talk about personal data or personal information, we mean any type of data that can identify a person either directly or indirectly, especially through that data.<br /><br /> It concerns to individuals who can be identified by an identification number or factors unique to their physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status. <br /><br /> This Privacy Policy is applicable to everyone who uses the App ("Users"). <br /><br /> For the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) purposes, we act as the data controller, unless indicated otherwise. <br /><br /> PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE HANDLED. BY USING THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.<br /><br /><strong>INFORMATION WE PROCESS</strong><br /><br />There are two general categories of information we can process.<br /><br />II.1 Information that you submit<br /><br />We process the following personal information about you when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us. Without this information it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services: 1) Authorization and/or Account Information. When you create/sign up for an account, we require your email. 2) Other Information directly related to your use of the App, such as photos and documents you upload to the App. Upon your consent we also may have access to your camera roll.<br /><br />II.2 Automatically Processed Information<br /><br /> When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, meaning it does not allow direct association with any specific individual. We process this information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services and features of the App. <br /><br /> We use third-party automatic data processing technologies which helps us analyze information from your device or the App. Automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) provide us with the data described below. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). As some of our third parties declare themselves as controllers for GDPR purposes, any requests regarding your personal data should be directed to these third parties.<br /><br /> Device-related information: When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, we may monitor one or more "device identifiers". Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties. Data that may be processed include:<br /> <ol> <li> Your mobile device type and the operating system versionwhich is installed on your mobile device; </li> <li> Your mobile device's regional settings; </li> <li> The region tied to your SIM card; </li> <li> Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address; </li> <li> An Identity For Advertisers/Advertising ID, which is a string of numbers and letters that identifies your individual smartphone or tablet.</li></ol> Log File Data: Automatically captured each time you request access to the App and when the App is installed on your device. Our analytics tools also automatically record specific log file data, such as the time and date of your App usage, along with your interaction with the App. <br /><br /> The App may engage in automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which is used to analyze or predict personal preferences, interests, behavior, location, or movements. This process begins automatically when you start using the App. <br /><br /> Cookies and Similar Technologies: To improve your experience, we may use cookies and technologies like pixels and web beacons when you use the App. A cookie is a small file downloaded to your device upon accessing the App, which is then sent back to our servers with each use of the App. This helps us operate the App efficiently, understanding which areas or features are popular and the content users are clicking on. We may partner with advertisers or other third parties to deliver ads and services in the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies. <br /><br /><ul> </ul> <strong>THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong><br /><br /> Our goal is to continually improve our App and introduce new experiences. In line with this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:<br /><br /> 1) To provide our service. We use both submitted information and automatically processed information to offer all services you request.<br /><br /> 2) To improve, test and monitor the effectiveness of our App. We use automatically processed information to better understand user behavior and trends, detect potential issues, and optimize our App.<br /><br /> 3) For personalized advertising and content. We may use automatically processed information for marketing purposes and to provide personalized, interest-based (behavioral) targeted content and ads.<br /><br /> 4) To communicate with you. We use the information we have to communicate with you through newsletters, marketing notifications, to receive your feedback about our App, and respond to you when you contact us.<br /><br /> 5) To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law. We really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our Terms of Use.<br /><br /> If we start processing your personal data for new purposes, we will inform you by updating this Privacy Policy accordingly. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br /><br /> We are committed to sharing your information in accordance with the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy.
